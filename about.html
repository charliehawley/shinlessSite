          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            I am a video editor, projectionist, web developer and artist based
            in St Leonards-on-sea, East Sussex.
            <br />
            <br />
            After graduating from Falmouth University in 2014, I moved to
            Peckham, London and began making music videos for local artists and
            friends. I unearthed a deep connection to all things visually
            ambiguous and adopted the mantra
            <em> 'making things that aren't from things that are.'</em>
            <br />
            <br />
            Shortly thereafter, I moved to St Leonards-on-sea and - having
            explored my own limits and capabilities within an abundance of NLEs
            - I discovered more abstract methodologies of creating moving image.
            <br />
            <br />
            Guiding hands and local artists Jude Montague and Becca Rose showed
            me programs like <a href="https://hydra.ojack.xyz/">Hydra</a> and
            <a href="https://derivative.ca/">TouchDesigner</a> and my world was
            expanded. Like an ecstatic child with new toys, I'm now gleefully
            sampling everything there is to offer within these new fields.
